How it works:
1. Text Analysis: The detector examines various linguistic features of the input text, such as sentence structure, vocabulary usage, and writing style.
2. Pattern Recognition: It looks for patterns that are commonly associated with AI-generated text, such as unusual word combinations or overly consistent writing styles.
3. Statistical Models: The detector employs machine learning models trained on large datasets of both human-written and AI-generated text to make its predictions.
4. Probability Calculation: Based on the analysis, it calculates the probability of the text being AI-generated and provides a confidence level for its prediction.

Important Note:
This detector has a tendency to produce false negatives. Effective prompt engineering can sometimes evade detection, resulting in AI-generated text being classified as human-written. However, it rarely produces false positives. This is because certain characteristics of default AI behavior are almost never seen in human-written content. As a result, when the detector identifies text as AI-generated, it's usually highly accurate.
